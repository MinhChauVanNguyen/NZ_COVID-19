# NZ's fictitious COVID-19 FLEXDASHBOARD

## About the data
The data (*number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases*) used in this dashboard was generated randomly using a simple mathematics algorithm and hence is completely fictitious and has nothing with to do with the true COVID-19 statistics in New Zealand. Information about population estimates, prioritised ethnicity and NZ Deprivation Index recorded at SA2 geographical level are not fabricated.
